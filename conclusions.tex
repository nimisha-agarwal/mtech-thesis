\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}
Online Tutoring System for Compilers is an automated system to help students in learning process. It takes CFG as input. Using the grammar, it determines the results of various parsing techniques. Based on these results, the tool generates questions automatically. If the answer is correct, it generates the next problem, otherwise, it generates hint questions to reach to the correct solution of the problem. It generates different type of hint questions.

Various challenges occur in developing the tool, which are listed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generation of input string for the cells of SLR Parsing table, which can be used in hint questions for the incorrectly entered cells of parsing table.
\item The tool is not developed for other parsing techniques such as CLR, LALR.
\item The tool has been developed only for the parsing phase of Compiler.
\end{enumerate}

Future work include the improvement of this tool. Some of them are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generation of input string for the cells of SLR Parsing table is in progress.
\item Develop the tool for other parsing techniques such as CLR, LALR.
\item Develop tools for other phases of Compiler and merge them into a single tool.
\end{enumerate}
