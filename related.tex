Computer-based Education systems have been in existence for quite a long time. The LISA tool \cite{mernik2003educational} founded by Marjan Mernik and Viljem Zumer, helps students in learning compilers through animations and visualizations. The tool is built for 3 phases of compiler - lexical analysis, syntax analysis and semantic analysis. For learning lexical analysis, animation is done in DFAs. Similarly, for syntax analysis, animation in construction of the synatx tree and for semantic analysis, animation in the node visits of the semantic tree and evaluation of attributes in the semantic tree is done.
